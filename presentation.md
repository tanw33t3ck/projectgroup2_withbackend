####Features
Our project - Travel With Us, is a B2C web application of a Tour Agency and the products are the Tour Packages.
This Web Application is designed for 2 groups people we call them users and admin.
For all users, the primary function of this web app is to display all Tour Packages. On top of that, it also allow users to narrow down by destination. Users will be able to express interest on a selected product by filling an online form.

Admins are users too but they work for "Travel With us" and have additional access on top of users. Admins can create, read, update and delete Tour Packages via a webpage that is only accessible upon authentication.

####Design Concept
The Logo:
Our logo is a plane positioned like an upward trend over a spherical formed by blue and green stripes. This signify that we are motivated and headed for growth and success. The spherical shape is an abstract representation of Earth and the colors represents the Sky and the Sea. 

The color: 
The header and footer are of the same color to give a consistent look and feel. The color comes from combining the color of Sky Blue and Sea Green.
